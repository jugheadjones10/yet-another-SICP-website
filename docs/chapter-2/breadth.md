# "Breadth" and drowning in information

I've loved reading articles ever since high school, when my Dad made a scathing remark about my lack of general knowledge. It started with news articles; I'd read New York Times every day on the bus to and from school. It made me feel smart reading the opinions of eloquent journalists.

Gradually as I moved into tech I became interested in more niche publications, like substacks, medium publications, and the like. Hacker News was like a gift from heaven - a neverending stream of nerd news, with sane, logical debate in the comment sections. 

All this time, I had an almost compulsive urge to save every piece of insight I came across. Discontented with the limited bookmark feature offered by browsers, I drifted from service to service - Feedly at first, then Trello cards, then Notion. My links accumulated, and with it the feeling that I had somehow digested all this information. In reality each new article was forgotten in a few days. I was substituting actual internalization with the reassuring but pointless act of copying and pasting links into a digital brain, not my own. 

What I want to start doing is use each insightful article as a trigger for my own thoughts, hypotheses, and questions about the article's topic. I want to be able to make connections between different topics, and gradually build up a model of the world that I can apply successfully to navigate real life. I want to be ready when the time comes to articulate my opinions on a particular issue. I dont't want to be dogmatic, mind - but rather possess a well-thought-out argument for why something might or should be a certain way. I feel like making effective decisions will be too hard without at least some amount of restrained opinion. 

And finally, I think breadth is just as important as depth. Sometimes, simply knowing that something exists might serve as a platform on which to build more creative ideas.

I'm not sure how to structure all the information just yet, but I know making it public is one part of the solution. Knowing other people may be seeing my analyses gives me that much more motivation to be rigorous and thoughtful.
