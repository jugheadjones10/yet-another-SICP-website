# Introduction

Each exercise will start with a "Code from the text" code snippet that shows any code that will be **relevant** to solving the question. That means it's there to help you understand the context and think about the solution, but in order to write the actual solution you might need more dependencies. 

I've made a standalone github repository that contains one dependency file for each question. The dependency-file for exercise 2.3, for example, is called **2.3-dep.scm**. In order to try the exercise, all you need to do is load the dependency file at the beginning :

```scheme
(load "2.3-dep.scm")
;           ;
;Your answer;
;           ;
```

Of course, you need to be inside the directory full of dependency files for the loading to work.


When another exercise is listed among one exercise's "dependencies", I may be referring to both the solutions to that exercise and other code displayed under that exercise's dependencies.
Make the above comment clearer.
